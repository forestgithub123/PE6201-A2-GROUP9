PE6201 · A2 scaffold — THE GUARDRAIL LAYER  (D3a)
====================================================================
Four things, and NONE of them involve a model. That is the point.

    1. STEP CAP            stop after N turns
    2. BUDGET CEILING      stop after N tokens
    3. ACTION DE-DUPLICATION   stop repeating an action already taken
    4. AUTONOMY GATE       hold the irreversible step for a human

A model cannot influence whether these fire, which is why D3(b)'s ten
guardrail cases run on the SCRIPTED backend. They test your code.

MAKE THE STOP LOUD. A cap that silently returns an empty answer is
worse than the loop it prevented: it turns a visible cost problem into
an invisible correctness problem. Every stop below records WHY.
